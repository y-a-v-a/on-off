# On/Off

A web-based interpretation of Martin Creed's "Work No. 227: The lights going on and off" (2000).

This webpage alternates the background color between white and black every few seconds, creating a simple but hypnotic visual experience inspired by Creed's conceptual art piece where gallery lights turned on and off at timed intervals.

## Reference

Based on Martin Creed's [Work No. 227: The lights going on and off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_No._227:_The_lights_going_on_and_off) - a minimalist installation that won the Turner Prize in 2001.
